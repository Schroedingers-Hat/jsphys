jsphys: javascript relativity simulator
=======================================

Provides a canvas-based JavaScript relativistic physics system for use in
demonstrating features of special relativity.

Features
--------

jsphys provies a framework for relativistic demos, using predefined scenarios
to demonstrate relativistic effects. Users can interact with the demos,
changing their reference frames, zooming in and out, and changing the playback
speed. Currently supported effects are:

* Relativistic Doppler shifting
* Length contraction of distances and of objects
* Time dilation
* Simple, arbitrarily shaped objects

Planned effects include relativistic beaming, arbirary object paths, and
detailed Minkowski diagrams of events as they unfold.

Requirements
------------

jsphys uses features like canvas and JavaScript typed arrays, requiring a 
recent browser. It has currently been tested on recent versions of Firefox
and Chrome.

Demo
----

A demo of the work-in-progress version of jsphys is available:
