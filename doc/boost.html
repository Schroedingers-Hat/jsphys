    <h1>Quick and dirty intro to the basic maths behind the jsrel portion 
    of jsphys.

      Assumed background knowledge, suffix 1 denotes some course at roughly
      highschool level, or intro college level depending on country. suffix 2
      denotes a college or university level course. This document should be 
      comprehensible but may be somewhat meaningless with just the maths:
      </dt>
        <dd>Linear Algebra 1</dd>
        <dd>Calc 1</dd>
        <dd>Trig 1</dd>
      <dt>Recommended:</dt>
        <dd>Calc 2</dd>
        <dd>Linear Algebra 2</dd>
        <dd>Physics 1</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Conventions and notation</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Brief list of conventions and notation used in this document
      and in the code where possible:</dt>
      <dd>
      Capital letters denote four vectors with time component last.
      Column vectors generally assumed unless stated.
      ie. <script>putv4(X)</script>
      </dd>
      <dd>
      Lower case non-bold letters \(x\) usually denote components but may
      denote 3-vectors in the code. 3-vectors will be bolded \(\mathbf{x}\)
      where possible.
      </dd>
      <dd>
      The metric used will be: <script>putm4(g)</script>
      This makes time-like intervals negative, and the interval formula is:
      \[s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - c^2t^2\]
      </dd>
      <dd>
      Within the internal-facing parts of the code, all spacetime units
      should metres, or the equivalent distance-like quantity including times.
      Energies will be in units of \(\mathrm{kg\,m^2}\). Anything intended to
      be seen by the user will be in the usual SI units.<br>
      Use of units in which \(c=1\) within this document except where directly
      referencing code should be considered grounds for hitting the author with
      a stick.
      </dd>
      <dd>The constant c, where it appears, should be kept in vectors rather
      than operators.</dd>
      <dd>
      \(V\) where it appears without a qualifier should be considered as the
      four-velocity \(\frac{d X}{d\tau}\) where \(\tau\) is proper time.
      </dd>
      <dd>\(v_t\) being the time component of four-velocity is interchangable
      with the lorentz constant \(\gamma\). The convention within the code is
      for the time component of any vector \(U\) to be U.t, ie.
      <code class='jush'><br>
        var U = vec4.create(1,2,3,4);<br>
        U.t
      </code> will be 4.

    <h2>Part 1: Derivation of boost formula from interval.</h2>
    <p>At its heart, this simulation is just lines and geometry. It maps a
    set of 4D points onto 3D and subsequently 2D in a way that is very
    closely analogous to the way traditional computer graphics maps 3D on
    to 2D. Even things like aberration which seem complicated and unrelated
    in component form are just intersections of lines and cones.</p>
