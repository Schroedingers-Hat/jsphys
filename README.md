jsphys: javascript physics simulation
=====================================

Provides canvas-based JavaScript physics demonstrations for classroom use,
including a live special relativity simulator.

Features
--------

jsphys encapsulates a growing library of simulations and explanations of
physical phenomena, from wave interference to special relativity.

### Relativity simulation

jsphys provies a framework for relativistic demos, using predefined scenarios
to demonstrate relativistic effects. Users can interact with the demos,
changing their reference frames, zooming in and out, and changing the playback
speed. Currently supported effects are:

* Relativistic Doppler shifting
* Length contraction of distances and of objects
* Time dilation
* Simple, arbitrarily shaped objects
* Minkowski diagrams of events as they unfold.

Planned effects include relativistic beaming and arbirary object paths.

Requirements
------------

jsphys uses features like canvas and JavaScript typed arrays, requiring a 
recent browser. It has currently been tested on recent versions of Firefox
and Chrome.

Demo
----

A demo of the work-in-progress version of jsphys is available:
