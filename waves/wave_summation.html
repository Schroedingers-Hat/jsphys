        <h1>Wave Interference</h2>
<p>There's an important principle in wave mechanics: the principle of 
<strong>superposition</strong>. Two waves can pass through the same space in
the same time, and the result is a wave that is the <em>sum</em> of those two
waves. And if you have three or four or seventy-seven waves, the net effect is
again simply the sum.</p>

<p>You've seen this before in a swimming pool. If the water were perfectly still,
you could drop a rock in and see the waves spread outward from the splash, in
neat little circles. But if there are people diving, practicing their
backstrokes, and playing water polo, there are waves coming from every
direction with a huge variety of amplitudes, frequencies, and wavelengths.
If you put a rubber ducky in the water at a specific location, it'll seem to
bob up and down almost at random. All the waves added together made a new,
complicated wave.</p>

<p>The complicated wave pattern comes from constructive and destructive
interference of waves, and it happens with water waves, sound waves, light
waves, waves on a string, and essentially any kind of wave.</p>

<p>How does it work? Consider what happens if I have two separate waves,
described by:</p>

\[ 
y_1(x,t) = A_1 \sin (kx - \omega t)
\]

\[
y_2(x,t) = A_2 \sin (kx - \omega t)
\]

<p>These waves have identical frequencies (they both have frequency \(\omega\)),
but different amplitudes (\(A_1\) and \(A_2\)). What happens when we add them
together? Well, we get:</p>

\[
y_1(x,t) + y_2(x,t) = (A_1 + A_2)\sin (kx - \omega t)
\]

<p>The result? A wave with an amplitude of \(A_1 + A_2\). This is 
<strong>constructive</strong> interference: the two waves combine to form a 
larger wave.</p>

<p>You can imagine how this makes sense. If you have two speakers playing music
side-by-side (and the speakers are playing the same music at the same time),
then the sound is louder than it would be if you only had one speaker. The
sound waves constructively interfere to form sound of a higher amplitude.
Likewise, if two large people jump into the swimming pool simultaneously,
the resulting waves are tremendous.</p>

<p>Now, suppose you have two waves that are <em>out of phase.</em> 
Mathematically, that would look like this:</p>

\[ 
y_1(x,t) = A \sin (kx - \omega t)
\]

\[
y_2(x,t) = A \sin (kx - \omega t - \phi)
\]

<p>\(\phi\) is a number called the <em>phase angle</em>. If the phase angle is
zero, then we're back to the situation from before, and there is constructive
interference. But suppose the phase angle is exactly \(\pi\). What happens
then? Let's draw a picture of those two waves:</p>

<img src="img/summation_pi_phase.png" alt="Two waves with a phase angle of pi" />

<p>When one wave is positive, the other is negative, with exactly the same
(but opposite) amplitude. When you add them, you get zero. This is
<strong>destructive</strong> interference. Destructive interference is not
always total; it's possible for one wave to be larger than the other, and hence
only be partially canceled out.</p>

<p>Those of you with noise-cancelling headphones experience this effect all the
time. How can the headphones make a loud airplane seem nearly silent? Well,
they have a small microphone which picks up all the outside sound coming toward
your ears, and quickly generate a new sound wave that exactly cancels out the
outside sound. The effect? Destructive interference. You barely hear a thing.</p>

<p>Now, there's a third possibility I haven't mentioned yet. What if the two
waves don't have the same frequency? We can represent those mathematically as
having different frequencies \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\). Their sum is rather
interesting. In the simulation below, we have two waves with different
frequencies (in color) and their sum (in black). Try playing with different
frequencies to see what happens. (Press Play to start the simulation.)</p>

<div class="simulation">
    <canvas id="wave-sum-sim" data-processing-sources="wave_summation.pde"></canvas>  
    <div class="controls">
        <p>Speed: </p><div class="slider" id="speed-slider"></div>
        <p><span style="color:rgb(0,127,0)">Wave 1</span> frequency:</p>
        <div class="slider" id="wave1-w-slider"></div>
        <p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,127)">Wave 2</span> frequency:</p>
        <div class="slider" id="wave2-w-slider"></div>
        <p>Phase angle:</p>
        <div class="slider" id="wave-phase-slider"></div>
        <p><button id="play" onclick="return false;">Play</button></p>
        <p><button id="listen" onclic="return false;">Listen</button></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Press the Listen button to see how interfering waves sound. When you listen
to music, or even speech, you're listening to exactly this effect: even a pure
note played by a musical instrument is actually a combination of many
frequencies played together, interfering. That's why two instruments playing
the same note still sound different &mdash; the lowest frequency is the same,
but the combination of other interfering frequencies is different.</p>

<p>For example, let's synthesize a piano playing the same middle C, at 262 Hz.
We'll plot it along with a pure sine wave at that frequency, showing how the
harmonics add up to make the piano sound entirely different, even when it plays
the same note.</p>

<p>A harmonic is a sound at a multiple of the original frequency. For example,
there might be harmonics of 262 Hz at 524 Hz, 786 Hz, 1048 Hz, and so on.
Different instrument designs produce different sets of harmonics. Here, let's
see a simulation of a piano:</p>

<div class="simulation">
    <canvas id="piano-sim" data-processing-sources="piano.pde"></canvas>
    <div class="controls">
        <p><button id="piano-play" onclick="return false;">Play</button></p>
        <p><button id="piano-listen" onclick="return false;">Listen to Piano</button></p>
        <p><button id="sine-listen" onclick="return false;">Listen to Pure Note</button></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>You can see that a pure note at 262 Hz looks very different from a piano
playing 262 Hz, and sounds very different as well.</p>
